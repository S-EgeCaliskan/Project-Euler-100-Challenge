## Multiples of 3 or 5

### Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

This problem was simple, just used the modulus with 3 and 5 for numbers below 1000. However, I needed to account for the fact that, since I used different conditions to find the multiples, I needed to make sure that the if statement that found multiples of 3 did not interfere with multiples of 5.
