### PROJECT EULER 100 CHALLANGE

This is a challenge I came across on FreeCodeCamp.org. The goal is to:

1) Solve the first 100 Project Euler problems.
2) You cannot skip a problem without solving it.
3) There is no time limit for solving a problem.
4) You can use any programming language you wish.

What I hope to learn with this challenge is that I am looking forward to sharpening my problem-solving skills across multiple languages. I am going to be using Python, Java, JavaScript and C# to solve these problems.

P.S. The problems for the corresponding codes can be found within the program at the beginning in comment format.
