## Sum square difference

### Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 +...+10^2=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
3025-385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

This problem was quite easy to solve thanks to JavaScripts callback functions used with arrays. Map and reduce functions made this problem quite easy to deal with. The user can specify any number they want, and the program makes an array ranging from 1 to the number in the argument. Then, using map and reduce functions, gets the square of the sum, and the sum of the squares and simply gets the desired result, outputting it onto the console.
