## Largest palindrome product

### Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

This was particularly rendered easy due to Python's ability of string manipulation. Instead of working with the numbers as integer types, I turned them into strings, and it made the solution a lot easier.
