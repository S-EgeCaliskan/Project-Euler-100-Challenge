### PROBLEM 2
## Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

This was not a difficult problem to work around. I just used two different variables to store the two initial numbers, a variable to store the total sum, and another variable to store the even numbers. I used a while loop to run the Fibonacci sequence as long as the sum was smaller than four million.

Then I merely manipulated the values of sum, x and y using addition and subtraction and kept moving the values one step forward.
